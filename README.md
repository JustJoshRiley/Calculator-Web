This custom calculator helps you identify your Basal Metabolic Rate. 
BMR is considered when using a calories burned calculator. 
This calculation makes up around 60% of your total energy expenditure. 
Your BMR depends on your sex, height, weight, and age. The calculation will vary. 
BMR will be calculated using the 1918 with the Harris-Benedict equation. 
This equation is based on the imperial system. In further detail.
Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the total number of calories that your body needs to perform basic, life-sustaining functions.
These basal functions include circulation, breathing, cell production, nutrient processing, protein synthesis, and ion transport.
You can calculate your basal metabolic rate using a mathematical formula but in this case we will do that for you!
